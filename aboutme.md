My name is Bart Jacobs.
The contact information you may need to reach me is on the bottom of every page.

### So what about me?

Bart Jacobs is a Senior System Engineer/Consultant based in Belgium. He started his career back in 1998. One of the first projects he worked on in those days was Citrix Metaframe 1.8 on Microsoft Windows NT 4 Terminal Server codename "Hydra".

Over the years, Citrix technology has always been a major theme in his professional career, resulting in becoming a true technical expert in the matter.
In the last few years, he has also become an expert in virtualization technology, with a special interest in a real challenger in this business: Citrix XenServer.  
Bart has founded his own company back in 2007 and is mainly working as a (Citrix) consultant now.  
In 2019, Bart received his first Citrix CTA award.   
In 2020, the CTA award got renewed.

### My history

Before this site existed, I have been writing and contributing to the Blog of the Great Carl Webster.  
You can find my archive [here](https://carlwebster.com/author/bartjacobs).  

Some day I may put these in an archive on here, or I may not. It depends. (Yes, I'm a consultant)
