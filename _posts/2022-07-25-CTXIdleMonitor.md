Synopsis: a variation to CTXDisconnectedMonitor.

If you are reading this, you should have heard about CTXDisconnectedMonitor by now. If not, feel free to read all about it here.
In this quick post, I want to discuss a minor variation to CTXDisconnectedMonitor. And I called it CTXIdleMonitor.

It does not take a lot of imagination what that could be. Instead of looking for sessions in a disconnected state, the script looks for idle sessions and logs them off. All the other logic is identical to CTXDisconnectedMonitor.

I did put this script variation in its repository on Github [here](https://github.com/Cloudsparkle/CTX-IdleMonitor).

Stay safe!
