Synopsis: The things I use to build tools for the Toolbox.

When I'm working on a new script, I often find myself opening a bunch of older scripts and copy-pasting some of that code.

That could be small things, like some lines of code to get the actual current directory. It could also be more significant, like the function I use to read an INI-file.

Either way, it was about time to get this a bit more organized. So I created a "Building Blocks" repo on GitHub, where I will often store stuff I (re-)use.

You can find the link [here](https://github.com/Cloudsparkle/Building-blocks). Check it out, as this will surely grow in the future.

Stay safe!
